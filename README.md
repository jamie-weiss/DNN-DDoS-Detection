# DNN-DDoS-Detection
Deep neural network approach for DDoS detection supporting the paper by Jamie Weiss.

### Getting Started
Navigate to the repository and install all required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Important Notes

1. The dataset complimenting this package is too big to upload to github.  A link to the dataset is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/devendra416/ddos-datasets)

2. This repository is supporting material for a paper titled: *DDoS Detection Using Deep Neural Networks on Packet Flows* by Jamie Weiss

3. The code is originally built in a Jupyter Notebook which is why it is formatted poorly.  In future commits the code will be cleaned up, I am sorry for that.
